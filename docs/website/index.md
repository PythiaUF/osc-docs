Website for the UF Open Source Club. Started in the Fall semester 2022, this website is built and maintained by club members to serve as a hub of information for the club.

## What is the Open Source Club?
The Open Source Club (OSC) at the University of Florida is a community of makers who want to solve problems and improve our world through open source projects. The club was founded in the Spring of 2016 as an official student organization at UF. In 2017, OSC were founding members of the Mozilla Open Source Student Network. Join us at casual codings, where we work on open source projects, do homework, or just hang out.
