# Spring Project Proposals (02-03-23)

Each semester, UF Open Source Club members propose and vote on projects to work on for the semester. Project proposals begin as open discussions, with members building on each others' ideas throughout the session. What follows is a transcript of the discussion notes.

## Dicussion Notes

1. Lunch buddy: (and its many iterations)
   - CS students have trouble making friends. Consolidate lunch buddy into a super app for matching people on UF campus for a specific purpose (i.e. running, gym, have lunch, pickup sports games/night mode makes it dinner buddy).
   - UF snap story has people trying to go to gym; find people to go to the gym with and lift gains. An athletics app and combine with sports lunch buddy idea?
   - Event buddy: An app that helps you find any socials/events happening near you that forces you to go outside and have social interaction.
   - Same thing as lunch buddy but to set up pickup games at a specific field/location; a pickup game tracker.
   - Running by yourself and unable to catch up to the person in front of you? Match with people close to your average mile and keep the pace in running. (Another athletic application to lunch buddy).
2. Discord bot:
   - Tamagotchi but as a discord bot (a cat or dog we need to feed).
3. Schedule helper.
4. OSC website.
5. Manim:
   - A plug-in for educational library to make CS language more accessible.
6. Comp sci club centralized calendar.
7. A video game where you could walk through it and learn how to code.
   - Education-based video game for programming; making coding/programming more accessible. Makes it interesting for children and makes programming more introduction-friendly and fun. Think of educating the youth in code through the fun of video games.
8. API group that works on micro projects for the non-committal type of coder:
   - Face Shazam (in API group).
   - Gather all API reminders into one centralized app (clubinfinity but better).
9. Club free stuff/merch add-on for the discord bot that uses instagram API that searches for keywords.
   - MIT app but for UF.
10. Tedious process for completing mundane questions on job applications; automate a bot to one-time fill in the information to auto apply for jobs, natural language processing.

	- ~~A piece of art to represent the club or actual utility function.~~
13. ~~Medical marijuana text-scraping bot.~~
14. ~~Minecraft moding team for servers, making Minecraft mods/community.~~
15. ~~Website that compiles everything about PC building (possible collab with another club?).~~

17. ~~Everyone can upload small videos about whatâ€™s going on at the UF campus (Barstool UF?).~~
18. ~~Airdrop for android.~~
19. ~~Program to convert IMDb reviews.~~
