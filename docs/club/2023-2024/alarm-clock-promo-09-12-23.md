Alarm clock was a unanimously beloved project proposal for the creation of an unethical alarm clock app. The premise was to create a high-stakes alarm clock that would force you to solve leetcode problems, threaten to call your parents, order food to your house, etc., if you didn't wake up.

It was proposed twice in 2023, first during the Spring semester, and later in Fall. This was a promotional video meant to encourage people to vote for the project. Ultimately, the project was not selected.
